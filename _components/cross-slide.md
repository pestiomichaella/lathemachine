## Function Details

### Primary Functions
- Control depth of cut
- Position tool precisely
- Enable fine adjustments
- Maintain consistent feed rates

### Operation
1. Loosen lock if engaged
2. Rotate handwheel to desired position
3. Read graduated dial for depth
4. Lock if holding position is required
5. Feed tool using handwheel

### Measurement
- Graduated dial usually shows 0.001" or 0.05mm per division
- Can measure both advance and depth
- Helps maintain consistent cuts

## Adjustment Tips

- Always move in consistent direction to avoid backlash
- Make small adjustments for precision work
- Use dial readings for repeatability
- Check for smooth operation before use

## Maintenance

- Keep clean and lubricated
- Verify smooth movement
- Check for worn threads or bearings
- Ensure dial accuracy

## Overview

The cross slide sits on the carriage and moves the tool straight into or away from the workpiece. This is the part you use to control the depth of the cut.

## Key Features

- **Precision Screw**: Accurate depth control
- **Handwheel**: Manual feed with graduated dial
- **Smooth Bearings**: Ensures smooth movement
- **Lock Mechanism**: Holds position when needed
- **Clearance**: Allows tool to approach workpiece

## Location

Mounted on top of the carriage, it moves perpendicular to the bed axis.

## Function Details

### Primary Functions
- Control depth of cut
- Position tool precisely
- Enable fine adjustments
- Maintain consistent feed rates

### Operation
1. Loosen lock if engaged
2. Rotate handwheel to desired position
3. Read graduated dial for depth
4. Lock if holding position is required
5. Feed tool using handwheel

### Measurement
- Graduated dial usually shows 0.001" or 0.05mm per division
- Can measure both advance and depth
- Helps maintain consistent cuts

## Adjustment Tips

- Always move in consistent direction to avoid backlash
- Make small adjustments for precision work
- Use dial readings for repeatability
- Check for smooth operation before use

## Maintenance

- Keep clean and lubricated
- Verify smooth movement
- Check for worn threads or bearings
- Ensure dial accuracy

## Key Features

- **Main Spindle**: Hollow shaft that holds and rotates the workpiece
- **Speed Control**: Allows adjustment of spindle rotation speed
- **Motor**: Provides the power to rotate the spindle
- **Gears**: Transfer power from motor to spindle
- **Bearings**: Support the spindle for smooth rotation

## Location

Found at the left end of the lathe machine, it is the stationary component that anchors the workpiece during operations.

## Function Details

### Primary Functions
- Hold and rotate the workpiece or chuck
- Provide speed variation capabilities
- Maintain precise spindle alignment
- Support heavy loads from workpieces

### Speed Range
Most lathes offer multiple speed ranges, typically from 30 to 3000 RPM, adjustable by belt or gear changes.

## Maintenance

- Keep the headstock free from dust and debris
- Check bearing lubrication regularly
- Inspect belts and pulleys for wear
- Ensure smooth spindle rotation with no runout

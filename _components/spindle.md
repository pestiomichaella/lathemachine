## Overview

The spindle is a hollow shaft located inside the headstock. The motor spins it, and it holds and rotates the workpiece or chuck. Its speed and rotation can be controlled for different tasks.

## Key Features

- **Hollow Design**: Allows passage of long bar stock
- **Taper Bore**: Accepts morse taper tools and centers
- **Chuck Mounting Surface**: Face and threads for chuck attachment
- **Precision Bearings**: Support smooth rotation
- **Speed Control**: Adjustable RPM via motor and transmission

## Location

Located inside the headstock, it is the rotating core of the lathe.

## Function Details

### Primary Functions
- Rotate the workpiece or chuck
- Transmit power from motor via gears
- Maintain precise concentricity
- Support radial and axial loads

### Specifications
- Typically tapered (Morse taper)
- Rotates on precision ball or roller bearings
- Speed range varies by machine (30-3000 RPM typical)
- Capable of both forward and reverse rotation

## Maintenance

- Keep clean and free of chips
- Check bearing lubrication
- Inspect taper bore for damage
- Verify smooth rotation with no runout
- Check alignment periodically

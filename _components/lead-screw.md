## Overview

The lead screw is a long, threaded rod that runs along the bed. It is key for making precise threads and works with the carriage to ensure controlled, accurate cuts.

## Key Features

- **Precise Threads**: Accurate thread pitch
- **Long Length**: Extends full length of bed
- **Smooth Operation**: Low friction bearings
- **Engagement Mechanism**: Can be engaged or disengaged
- **Speed Control**: Works with motor to control feed rate

## Location

Runs horizontally along the entire length of the bed, typically underneath the carriage.

## Function Details

### Primary Functions
- Control carriage movement for threading
- Provide synchronized feed
- Enable automatic feeding
- Maintain precise pitch for threads

### Lead Screw Pitch
- Determines thread pitch that can be created
- Common pitches: 8 TPI, 10 TPI, 12 TPI
- Can be changed with gearing for different pitches

### Threading Process
1. Engage lead screw clutch
2. Set spindle speed
3. Position tool at thread start
4. Engage feed
5. Lead screw drives carriage at precise rate
6. Disengage at thread end

## Maintenance

- Keep clean and free of chips
- Apply appropriate machine oil
- Verify smooth rotation
- Check thread condition
- Inspect bearing operation

## Safety Notes

- Never use lead screw for manual carriage feed during threading
- Always disengage before reversing spindle
- Keep hands clear during threading

## Overview

The carriage is the moving part that rides along the bed, carrying the cutting tool. It allows the tool to move side-to-side (longitudinal) and front-to-back (cross-feed).

## Key Features

- **Tool Post Mount**: Holds the cutting tool
- **Cross Slide**: Controls depth of cut
- **Handwheels**: Manual feed control
- **Smooth Bearings**: Ensure smooth movement

## Location

Positioned on the bed between the headstock and tailstock, it moves longitudinally along the entire length.

## Function Details

### Primary Functions
- Carry and position the cutting tool
- Provide longitudinal movement (along the bed)
- Provide cross-feed movement (perpendicular to bed)
- Allow precise tool placement

### Movement Types
- **Longitudinal Feed**: Movement along the bed axis
- **Cross Feed**: Movement perpendicular to the bed
- **Manual Control**: Via handwheels
- **Automatic Feed**: Powered by lead screw or feed rod

## Overview

The bed is the strong, stable base that runs along the length of the lathe. It holds up all the other major parts: the headstock, tailstock, and carriage.

## Key Features

- **Rigid Construction**: Cast iron or fabricated steel
- **V-Shaped Ways**: Guide rails for carriage movement
- **Precision Ground Surfaces**: Ensure accurate alignment
- **Oil Grooves**: Allow lubrication to flow for smooth operation

## Location

Runs horizontally along the entire length of the lathe from headstock to tailstock.

## Function Details

### Primary Functions
- Support all major components
- Guide the carriage movement
- Maintain precise alignment
- Prevent vibration and deflection

### Construction
- Typically made of cast iron for stability and vibration damping
- V-shaped and flat ways ensure accurate tool positioning
- Precision grinding ensures flatness and accuracy

## Maintenance

- Clean oil and chips regularly
- Apply appropriate machine oil to ways
- Check for straightness and alignment
- Inspect for cracks or damage
- Ensure it sits level on the machine base

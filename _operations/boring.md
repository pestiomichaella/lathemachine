## Overview

Boring involves enlarging a hole that has already been drilled or cast. The process is used to achieve greater accuracy in diameter and to attain a smooth internal finish.

## Purpose of Boring

- Enlarge holes to precise diameters
- Create smooth internal surfaces
- Achieve tight tolerances for fitted components
- Create internal threads or grooves

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Secure workpiece with pre-drilled hole
2. Mount boring tool in tool post
3. Align tool at hole centerline
4. Start lathe and set appropriate speed
5. Feed boring tool inside hole for precision enlargement
6. Take multiple light passes
7. Stop lathe and inspect hole

## Important Techniques

- Use light passes to maintain accuracy
- Ensure the tool is perfectly centered
- Monitor for vibration, especially with deep holes
- Use appropriate cutting speeds and feed rates
- Check diameter frequently with calipers

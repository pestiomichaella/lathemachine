## Overview

Boring involves enlarging a hole that has already been drilled or cast. The process is used to achieve greater accuracy in diameter and to attain a smooth internal finish.

## Purpose of Boring

- Enlarge holes to precise diameters
- Create smooth internal surfaces
- Achieve tight tolerances for fitted components
- Create internal threads or grooves

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Ensure a pilot hole of adequate diameter has been drilled in the workpiece.
2. Mount the workpiece securely in the chuck and install the boring bar in the tool post, minimizing tool overhang.
3. Set the cutting edge of the boring tool at the workpiece center height.
4. Select appropriate spindle speed and feed rate for internal cutting.
5. Start the spindle and feed the boring tool into the existing hole to the required depth.
6. Perform roughing passes to enlarge the hole close to the specified diameter.
7. Perform one or more finishing passes with reduced depth of cut to obtain the final diameter and surface finish.
8. Stop the machine and verify the internal diameter using suitable measuring instruments.

## Important Techniques

- Use light passes to maintain accuracy
- Ensure the tool is perfectly centered
- Monitor for vibration, especially with deep holes
- Use appropriate cutting speeds and feed rates
- Check diameter frequently with calipers

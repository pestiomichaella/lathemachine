## Overview

Polishing on a lathe enhances the surface finish of the workpiece. Using abrasives or polishing tools, the lathe spins the workpiece while the operator holds the polishing material against it.

## Applications

- Decorative items
- Precision instruments
- Final finishing
- Surface enhancement

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Secure workpiece
2. Use polishing tool or abrasive
3. Run lathe at suitable speed
4. Apply polishing material to surface
5. Continue until desired finish

## Best Practices

- Higher speeds produce better finishes
- Use light, even pressure
- Apply polishing compound regularly
- Work systematically across the surface
- Always move away from the center
- Never reach across the rotating workpiece

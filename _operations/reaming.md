## Overview

Reaming is the process of finishing and sizing a hole to a precise diameter. A reamer tool is slowly fed into a pre-drilled hole while the workpiece rotates.

## Purpose

- Achieve tight tolerances
- Produce smooth finishes
- Enlarge holes precisely
- Prepare holes for fasteners

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Drill undersized hole
2. Mount reamer in tailstock
3. Align reamer
4. Start lathe at slow speed
5. Feed reamer to finish hole
6. Retract tool and stop lathe

## Important Points

- Always start with a pre-drilled hole
- Use slow speeds to prevent chatter
- Keep the reamer aligned with the hole axis
- Use proper cutting fluid
- Remove the reamer carefully
- Check the final hole size with precision instruments

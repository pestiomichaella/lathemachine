## Overview

Reaming is the process of finishing and sizing a hole to a precise diameter. A reamer tool is slowly fed into a pre-drilled hole while the workpiece rotates.

## Purpose

- Achieve tight tolerances
- Produce smooth finishes
- Enlarge holes precisely
- Prepare holes for fasteners

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Drill a hole slightly smaller than the final required diameter, following standard drill size recommendations for reaming.
2. Mount the reamer in the tailstock chuck or suitable holder and align the tailstock with the spindle axis.
3. Select a relatively low spindle speed and apply appropriate cutting fluid.
4. Start the spindle and advance the reamer steadily into the rotating workpiece, avoiding excessive force.
5. Allow the reamer to cut with a continuous motion until it passes through the entire hole or reaches the specified depth.
6. Withdraw the reamer carefully while the spindle is still rotating or after stopping, according to shop practice and tool recommendations.
7. Clean the hole and verify the final diameter and surface finish using appropriate measuring instruments.

## Important Points

- Always start with a pre-drilled hole
- Use slow speeds to prevent chatter
- Keep the reamer aligned with the hole axis
- Use proper cutting fluid
- Remove the reamer carefully
- Check the final hole size with precision instruments

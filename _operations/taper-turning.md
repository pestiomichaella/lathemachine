## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Secure workpiece
2. Set tailstock or compound rest angle
3. Install cutting tool
4. Turn on lathe and set speed
5. Cut taper by feeding tool diagonally
6. Complete passes to finish taper

## Methods

- **Tailstock Offset Method**: Move tailstock to create angle
- **Compound Rest Method**: Rotate compound rest to desired angle
- **Attachment Method**: Use taper turning attachment

## Precision Points

- Calculate taper angle accurately
- Verify angle with taper gauge
- Make light passes for accuracy
- Check taper frequently

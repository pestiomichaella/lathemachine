## Overview

Knurling is the process of creating a regular, cross-patterned texture on the surface of a workpiece. This is typically done to provide a better grip on the finished part.

## Applications

- Tool handles and grips
- Knobs and adjustment dials
- Components requiring non-slip surfaces
- Decorative applications

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Secure workpiece
2. Mount knurling tool and set center height
3. Run lathe at low speed
4. Feed knurling tool onto workpiece surface
5. Apply consistent pressure to emboss texture
6. Stop lathe and check pattern

## Best Practices

- Start with low speeds to allow the tool to engage smoothly
- Maintain even pressure throughout the knurling process
- The pattern should be uniform and consistent
- Avoid excessive pressure that could damage the tool
- Clean the knurling tool frequently

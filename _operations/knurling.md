## Overview

Knurling is the process of creating a regular, cross-patterned texture on the surface of a workpiece. This is typically done to provide a better grip on the finished part.

## Applications

- Tool handles and grips
- Knobs and adjustment dials
- Components requiring non-slip surfaces
- Decorative applications

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Mount the workpiece securely in the chuck and ensure adequate support if the workpiece is long.
2. Install the knurling tool (with the required pattern) in the tool post, aligning it perpendicular to the workpiece axis.
3. Set the knurling wheels at or slightly below center height.
4. Select a moderate spindle speed appropriate for knurling operations.
5. Position the knurling wheels against the rotating workpiece and apply sufficient transverse feed to impress the pattern uniformly.
6. Maintain steady pressure and feed the tool along the length of the area to be knurled.
7. After achieving the desired pattern depth, retract the knurling tool and stop the machine.
8. Inspect the knurled surface for uniformity and remove any burrs if necessary.

## Best Practices

- Start with low speeds to allow the tool to engage smoothly
- Maintain even pressure throughout the knurling process
- The pattern should be uniform and consistent
- Avoid excessive pressure that could damage the tool
- Clean the knurling tool frequently

## Overview

Turning is the fundamental process of removing material from the outer diameter of a workpiece to produce a cylindrical shape. This is the most common operation performed on a lathe.

## Types of Turning

### Straight Turning
Removing material along the external surface to reduce diameter uniformly.

### Taper Turning
Cutting a conical shape into the workpiece by adjusting the angle of the cutting tool.

### Contour Turning
Shaping the workpiece into a complex profile using a specially shaped cutting tool.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Secure workpiece in chuck or centers
2. Install proper cutting tool and set to center height
3. Turn on lathe and set appropriate speed
4. Move tool to starting position
5. Engage cutting tool and remove material from outer diameter
6. Perform successive passes until desired dimension and finish
7. Turn off lathe and inspect workpiece

## Tips for Success

- Always ensure the workpiece is securely held before starting
- Make multiple light passes rather than one heavy pass
- Keep the tool sharp for better results
- Use appropriate cutting speeds for the material

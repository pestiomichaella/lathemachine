## Overview

Drilling on a lathe involves creating a round hole in the workpiece, typically using a drill bit secured in the tailstock. This operation allows for precise hole creation in terms of diameter and depth.

## Types of Drilling

- **Central Drilling**: Creating holes along the center axis
- **Off-Center Drilling**: Creating holes at specific locations
- **Deep Hole Drilling**: Multiple passes for very deep holes

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Center the workpiece in the chuck and face the end if necessary to obtain a flat surface.
2. Mount a center drill in the tailstock drill chuck and align the tailstock with the spindle axis.
3. Start the spindle at a moderate speed and advance the center drill to produce a starting center hole.
4. Replace the center drill with the required twist drill of the specified diameter.
5. Select a suitable spindle speed and apply cutting fluid, if appropriate.
6. Advance the drill gradually into the rotating workpiece using the tailstock handwheel, periodically retracting to clear chips.
7. Continue drilling until the desired depth is reached.
8. Withdraw the drill completely, stop the machine, and verify the hole depth and diameter.

## Best Practices

- Use slower speeds for larger diameter drills
- Apply steady, even pressure when drilling
- Allow the drill to exit completely before retracting
- Clear chips frequently for deep holes
- Ensure proper centering before starting

## Overview

Drilling on a lathe involves creating a round hole in the workpiece, typically using a drill bit secured in the tailstock. This operation allows for precise hole creation in terms of diameter and depth.

## Types of Drilling

- **Central Drilling**: Creating holes along the center axis
- **Off-Center Drilling**: Creating holes at specific locations
- **Deep Hole Drilling**: Multiple passes for very deep holes

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Secure workpiece
2. Mount drill bit in tailstock
3. Align drill bit with hole location
4. Advance tailstock until drill contacts workpiece
5. Start lathe and set suitable speed
6. Feed drill into workpiece to drill hole
7. Retract drill and stop lathe

## Best Practices

- Use slower speeds for larger diameter drills
- Apply steady, even pressure when drilling
- Allow the drill to exit completely before retracting
- Clear chips frequently for deep holes
- Ensure proper centering before starting

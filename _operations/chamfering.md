## Overview

Chamfering involves cutting a bevel or angled edge on the workpiece. On a lathe, this is achieved by positioning the cutting tool at an angle to the workpiece's edge.

## Purpose

- Remove sharp edges for safety
- Prepare parts for fitting
- Improve aesthetics
- Facilitate assembly

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Install chamfering tool and set height
2. Secure workpiece
3. Start lathe and adjust speed
4. Feed tool to cut bevel edge
5. Stop lathe and inspect chamfer

## Guidelines

- Standard chamfer angle is typically 45 degrees
- Keep the angle consistent
- Maintain proper tool height
- Use light pressure
- Verify angle and size after completion

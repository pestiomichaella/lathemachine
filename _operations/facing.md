## Overview

Facing involves cutting the end of the workpiece to produce a flat surface. It's often the first operation performed on a lathe to create a clean, flat starting point for further machining.

## Purpose of Facing

- Create a clean, flat surface for subsequent operations
- Establish a reference surface for measurements
- Prepare the workpiece for drilling or turning operations
- Remove surface irregularities

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Secure workpiece and ensure it runs true
2. Secure the facing tool (tool bit) into the tool post
3. Install facing tool at center height
4. Turn on lathe and adjust speed
5. Position tool at face edge
6. Feed tool across face toward center
7. Repeat if needed for smooth flat surface
8. Turn off lathe and verify flatness

## Key Points

- The tool must be precisely at center height
- Feed the tool steadily from the edge toward the center
- Multiple light passes produce better results than one heavy pass
- Check flatness with a straightedge after completion

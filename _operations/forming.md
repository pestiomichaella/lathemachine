## Overview

Forming on a lathe involves shaping a workpiece into a specific contour or profile. This is achieved by using a forming tool whose cutting edge has the shape of the desired profile.

## Applications

- Cam profiles
- Complex contours
- Decorative elements
- Custom shapes

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Mount forming tool with desired profile
2. Set tool height at centerline
3. Secure workpiece
4. Start lathe and set speed
5. Feed tool against workpiece to shape profile
6. Inspect formed shape

## Key Techniques

- The tool profile must be accurately ground
- Single pass forming saves time
- Ensure uniform pressure during the pass
- Slower speeds provide better control
- Verify the profile matches requirements -->

## Overview

Threading is a precise operation to create threads on the outer or inner surface of a workpiece. This is achieved by moving a threading tool at a predetermined feed rate along the rotating workpiece, matching the pitch of the desired thread.

## Types of Threads

- **External Threads**: Threads on the outside of a shaft
- **Internal Threads**: Threads inside a hole
- **Metric Threads**: Measured in millimeters
- **Inch Threads**: Measured in threads per inch (TPI)

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Secure the workpiece in the chuck and prepare the external surface by turning it to the appropriate starting diameter for the thread.
2. Install the single-point threading tool, ground to the required thread form, and set the cutting edge at center height.
3. Set the lathe’s quick-change gearbox and leadscrew to the desired thread pitch.
4. Select a suitable low spindle speed for threading.
5. Start the spindle and engage the half-nut lever at the correct alignment mark to synchronize the tool with the workpiece.
6. Make an initial light threading pass to establish the thread path, then retract the tool and reverse or stop the spindle as required.
7. Increase the depth of cut gradually and repeat threading passes until the desired thread depth is reached.
8. Check the thread using thread gauges or mating parts, and perform a final light pass if necessary to improve finish and accuracy.

## Critical Points

- The lead screw must be engaged for synchronized feed
- Multiple light passes produce better threads than one deep cut
- Measure thread pitch and depth carefully
- Maintain constant spindle speed
- Disengage feed and reverse before exiting the thread

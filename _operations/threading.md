## Overview

Threading is a precise operation to create threads on the outer or inner surface of a workpiece. This is achieved by moving a threading tool at a predetermined feed rate along the rotating workpiece, matching the pitch of the desired thread.

## Types of Threads

- **External Threads**: Threads on the outside of a shaft
- **Internal Threads**: Threads inside a hole
- **Metric Threads**: Measured in millimeters
- **Inch Threads**: Measured in threads per inch (TPI)

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Insert threading tool and set height to centerline
2. Set lathe pitch and spindle speed
3. Position tool at thread start
4. Engage synchronized feed for thread pitch
5. Make repeated passes, increasing depth
6. Stop lathe and inspect threads

## Critical Points

- The lead screw must be engaged for synchronized feed
- Multiple light passes produce better threads than one deep cut
- Measure thread pitch and depth carefully
- Maintain constant spindle speed
- Disengage feed and reverse before exiting the thread

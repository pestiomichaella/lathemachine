## Overview

Grooving involves creating narrow grooves or channels on a workpiece. A specific grooving tool is carefully fed into the workpiece while it rotates on the lathe.

## Applications

- O-ring seats for hydraulic systems
- Oil grooves for lubrication
- Snap ring grooves
- Decorative grooves

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. Secure workpiece
2. Install grooving tool and set height
3. Turn on lathe and adjust speed
4. Feed tool to cut narrow groove
5. Stop lathe and inspect groove

## Important Considerations

- Groove depth must be precise
- Width is determined by tool size
- Multiple passes may be needed for deep grooves
- Use proper cutting fluid for better results
- Measure groove dimensions carefully

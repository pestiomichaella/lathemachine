# Lathe Accessories and Attachments

Several accessories are widely used with lathe machines to expand their capabilities in machining tasks.

## Centres

Centres are vital for supporting and aligning the workpiece during turning, facing, and tapering operations. They help maintain stability and ensure accurate rotation.

### Types of Centres
- **Ordinary Centre**: A general-purpose support used in smaller or routine turning tasks
- **Tipped Centre**: Equipped with a hardened tip designed to resist wear and deformation
- **Ball Centre**: Designed for taper turning with minimal wear, its rounded shape aids smoother tapering
- **Insert Type Centre**: Cost-efficient option allowing replacement of only the insert portion
- **Half Centre**: Similar to ordinary centre but with a portion removed for special shapes
- **Pipe Centre**: Used primarily to support hollow cylindrical workpieces like pipes
- **Frictionless Centre**: Found in tailstocks, can endure high forces while rotating freely at high speeds

## Chucks

Chucks hold the workpiece firmly on the lathe to perform various machining operations.

### Types of Chucks
- **3-Jaw Universal Chuck**: Has three jaws that move together to grip round or hexagonal pieces securely
- **4-Jaw Independent Chuck**: Features four jaws that adjust separately to hold irregularly shaped workpieces
- **Combination Chuck**: Combines both self-centering and independent jaw capabilities for added versatility

## Catch Plates and Carriers

These accessories transmit rotational motion to the workpiece when held between centres.

- **Carriers**: Attach directly to the workpiece using setscrews
- **Catch Plates**: Mount on the lathe headstock and have pins to engage the carrier for accurate driving

## Face Plate

A circular plate with slots and threads used to clamp irregularly shaped workpieces that cannot be held by chucks or centres.

## Angle Plate

A cast iron tool with two perpendicular faces, featuring holes and slots for securing workpieces, especially when horizontal support is required.

## Mandrels

Mandrels hold rotating parts like drilled, stepped, or bored workpieces for further machining. Different types exist for various shapes and features:

- Plain mandrels
- Stepped mandrels
- Cone mandrels
- Screw mandrels
- Gang mandrels

## Rests

Rests support long workpieces to prevent deflection and vibration when machining between centres.

### Types of Rests
- **Steady Rest**: A clamped frame with adjustable jaws placed between centres to hold long workpieces securely
- **Follower Rest**: Mounted on the carriage, moves with the tool to support the workpiece close to the cutting zone, ideal for finishing passes

## Attachments for Extended Capability

### Milling Attachment for Lathe

This attachment allows a lathe to perform milling operations such as:
- Cutting helical grooves
- Flat surface cutting
- Deep threads
- Worms, keyways, and T-slots

Usually replaces the compound rest and consists of a milling head with a spindle to hold the milling cutter, often powered by a motor.

### Taper Turning Attachment for Lathe

The taper turning attachment lets the lathe cut tapered shapes by adjusting the angle of the spindle axis. It works through a linkage connected to the cross slide, moving along a guide bar during turning. When the top slide is swung 90 degrees to a perpendicular position, it enables precise control over the cut depth.

### Grinding Attachment for Lathe

Used for sharpening tools like milling cutters and reamers, the grinding attachment mounts a grinder onto the lathe's compound rest. The lathe bedways are protected by cloth covers, and water or oil collects grinding residue to prevent dust buildup. It supports cylindrical grinding, splining, and groove finishing.

### Gear Cutting Attachment for Lathe

This attachment allows the lathe to cut various gear types including:
- Bevel gears
- Spur gears
- External keyway cutting
- Linear indexing
- Slotting

This greatly increases the lathe's versatility.

### Spherical Turning Attachment for Lathe

Designed to machine curved surfaces such as:
- Concave shapes
- Convex shapes
- Spherical shapes

This attachment mounts on the cross slide and positions the tool post at special angles relative to the workpiece for accurate shaping of spherical profiles.

# Lathe Machine Safety Guidelines

Operating a lathe machine demands strict adherence to safety protocols to prevent accidents and injuries. Safety is not negotiable.

## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Always wear appropriate protective gear when working on a lathe.

### Required PPE
- **Safety Glasses**: With side shields to protect eyes from flying debris and chips
- **Closed-Toe Shoes**: Sturdy footwear to protect feet from dropped objects
- **Work Clothes**: Well-fitting, no loose fabric
- **Hair**: Tie back long hair securely to prevent entanglement

### NOT Recommended
- **Gloves**: Avoid during machine operation - serious entanglement hazard
- **Loose Jewelry**: Remove all loose jewelry, watches, and chains
- **Loose Clothing**: Tuck in shirts and avoid baggy pants
- **Necklaces**: Keep clear of rotating parts

## Secure the Workpiece Correctly

- Ensure the material is firmly clamped in the chuck or between centers before starting
- Confirm that the chuck key or any adjustment tools are removed immediately after setup
- Avoid accidental startup hazards
- Manually rotate the chuck by hand to check for binding

## Use Proper Tooling and Speeds

- Always select cutting tools suited to the material and operation
- Adjust the spindle speed accordingly for material and tool type
- Running the lathe at excessive speeds can increase risks and reduce control
- Choose appropriate rotational speeds, with slower speeds for larger diameters

## Maintain a Clean Work Area

- Keep the lathe and surrounding area free from oil, grease, and metal or wood chips
- Remove chips only when the machine has stopped
- Use a brush or vacuum rather than bare hands
- Keep the lathe bed clear of tools, bits, and scrap materials

## Inspect the Machine and Accessories

- Regularly check belts, pulleys, guards, and cutting tools for wear or damage
- Replace or repair faulty components promptly
- All belts, pulleys, and moving parts should have guards in place
- Replace any worn or damaged belts and pulleys immediately

## Follow Safe Operating Procedures

- Do not make adjustments or measurements while the lathe is running
- Avoid leaning on the machine or placing hands near rotating parts
- Use guards to shield moving components and prevent pinch points
- Never leave the chuck key inserted; always remove and store it safely
- Stop the machine before making any adjustments or measurements

## Emergency Stop Awareness

- Know the location of emergency stop switches
- Use them if abnormal noises, vibrations, or tool breakage occur
- Test emergency stops regularly
- Ensure they are always accessible

## Maintenance and Repairs

- Adhere to lock-out/tag-out procedures during servicing
- Ensure the machine cannot start unexpectedly
- Follow facility procedures for maintenance
- Only qualified personnel should perform repairs
- Keep maintenance records

## Operating Practices

- When roughing, avoid forcing the cutting tool or taking overly large cuts
- Remain aware of the direction and speed of carriage motion
- Never stop the chuck rotation abruptly by reversing power except in specific tasks
- Do not engage power to remove or mount the chuck - do this manually
- Never reach toward rotating parts or the cutting tool

## If Abnormal Conditions Occur

- Stop the machine at once
- Investigate the issue before continuing
- Report unusual noises or vibrations immediately
- Check for loose parts or misalignment
- Do not resume operation until issue is resolved

## Reporting Unsafe Conditions

- Immediately report any unsafe conditions to the designated safety authority
- Remove the lathe from service until the issue is resolved
- Document all incidents and near-misses
- Participate in safety training programs
- Follow all facility safety procedures

# Assessment

### Part III: Components

**Instructions:** Choose the best answer for the multiple-choice questions or complete the sentence with the most appropriate component.

1.	Which set of components is directly responsible for carrying and precisely positioning the cutting tool for both longitudinal and cross-feed movements? 
    
    A. Headstock, Spindle, and Chuck 
    
    B. Bed, Lead Screw, and Feed Rod 
    
    C. Carriage, Cross Slide, and Compound Rest
    
    D. Tailstock, Tool Post, and Apron

2.	The ______ is primarily used for precise threading operations , while the adjacent _______  is used for automatic movement of the carriage for non-threading cuts.

3.	The main purpose of the ______ is to support the far end of long workpieces to prevent bending , but it also holds tools like drills for making holes.

4.	The _______ is the component that must be supremely rigid to prevent shaking that could ruin the work's accuracy.

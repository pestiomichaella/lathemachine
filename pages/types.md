Lathe machines are essential tools, but they are designed in many different ways to meet specific production needs. Understanding these variations is important because each type is optimized for a particular task, whether it involves size, speed, or precision. These machines incorporate specialized features—such as computer controls, heavy-duty frames, or unique tool holders—that determine their ideal application in manufacturing.

# Assessment

## Part IV: Types

**Instructions:** Match the manufacturing scenario (1-5) with the most appropriate lathe type (A-E) by writing the corresponding letter.

| Scenario | Lathe Type |
|----------|-----------|
| 1. Mass production of identical, small, complex medical device components that are long and thin. | E. CNC Swiss-Type Lathe |
| 2. Boring and facing a massive, heavy turbine disk for a power generation plant. | D. Vertical Lathe (VTL) |
| 3. A university machine shop needs a standard, versatile machine for general turning practice on single-part jobs. | A. Engine Lathe (Center Lathe) |
| 4. Production of a large batch of identical fasteners, requiring automated, unsupervised tool changes and material feed. | C. Automatic Lathe |
| 5. A tool and die shop needs to create a highly accurate gauge, demanding the greatest possible control and precision settings. | B. Tool Room Lathe |
